    This acts as a command queue between the aws-c-io event loop and the libuv event loop. JS callbacks can only
    be invoked within the libuv event loop, so we queue them up, and tell the uv loop to call our message pump.

    There only needs to be 1 aws_uv_context per application, the default one. It fine to create any number of
    contexts, but it will most likely only help from a lock contention/categorization perspective.

    Typical flow will look like:
    [optional] Grab default context OR allocate one
    aws_uv_context_acquire(ctx)
    ...
    aws_uv_context_enqueue(ctx, fn, user_data)
    ...
    aws_uv_context_release(ctx)

    Note that init/cleanup do ref counting, so it is necessary to call init/cleanup for each object referencing
    the aws_uv_context.
